          			<p> I am currently a Doctoral Student at Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar, working with Dr. Sairam S. Mallajosyula since 2019 August. </p>
          			<p> Prior to joining Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar, I earned my BS-MS Dual Degree in Chemical Sciences from IISER Kolkata in 2019. 
				My MS thesis focused on the synthesis and chacterization of polymeric chemosensors for formaldehyde detection. You can read further about the

				<p> My Research interests are mainly focused on the investigating the conformational dynamics of hexose monosaccharides and the impact of polarization
				on the same. You can read more about that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.2c01286" target="blank"> here. </a> I am also involved in the improvement of FF parameters for hexose sugars using CHARMM parametrization strategy.</p>

						Analysis of crystal structures of hexose monosaccharides α-D-mannose (α-MAN), β-D-mannose (β-MAN), α-D-glucose (α-GLC), β-D-glucose (β-GLC), α-D-galactose (α-GAL), β-D-galactose (β-GAL), α-D-altrose (α-ALT), β-D-altrose (β-ALT), α-D-idose (α-IDO), and β-D-idose (β-IDO) reveals that the monosaccharide ring adopts multiple ring conformations. These ring conformations can be broadly classified as chair, half-chair, envelope, boat, and skew-boat conformations. The ability of the monosaccharide ring to adopt multiple conformations has been closely tied with their bioactivity. However, it has been difficult to capture the dynamic information of these conformations from experimental studies. Even from simulations, capturing these different conformations is challenging because of the energy barriers involved in the transitions between the stable 4C1 and 1C4 chair forms. In this study, we analyze the influence of the polarizable force field on the ring dynamics of five major types of unsubstituted aldohexoses─glucose, mannose, galactose, altrose, and idose─and their anomers. We simulate microsecond trajectories to capture the influence of the CHARMM36 additive and polarizable carbohydrate force fields on the ring dynamics. The microsecond trajectories allow us to comment on the issues associated with equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Further, we use the extended system adaptive biasing force (eABF) method to compare the conformational sampling efficiencies of the additive and polarizable force fields. Our studies reveal that inclusion of polarization enhances the sampling of ring conformations and lowers the energy barriers between the 4C1 and 1C4 conformations. Overall, the CHARMM36 additive force field is observed to be rigid and favor the 4C1 conformations. Although the inclusion of polarizability results in enhancing ring flexibility, we observe sampling that does not agree with experimental results, warranting a revision of the polarizable Drude parameters.

						The ring conformations in hexose monosaccharides can be broadly classified as chair, half-chair, envelope, boat and skew-boat conformations. The ability of the monosaccharide ring to adopt multiple conformations has been closely tied with their biological function. However, it has been difficult to capture the dynamics of these conformational transitions from experimental studies. The timescale related issues make conformational rearrangement in the pyranose ring more problematic for both experiments (NMR spectroscopy) and simulations when compared to exocyclic group dynamics. Moreover, it has recently been shown that the hydrodynamic properties of carbohydrate containing systems are significantly affected by ring puckering. There has not been a single event of the ring puckering during microsecond long unbiased MD simulations of the hexose monosaccharide systems, characterized by much higher free energy barriers separating particular puckers. Herein, we focus on producing and analyzing the set of transition paths leading from 4C1 and 1C4 conformers in six major aldohexoses, α-D-mannose (α-MAN), β-D-mannose (β-MAN), α-D-glucose (α-GLC), β-D-glucose (β-GLC), α-D-galactose (α-GAL), β-D-galactose (β-GAL), by the application of Well-Tempered metadynamics (WTMetaD) in CHARMM36 additive force field and subsequent QM calculations and analyses of the resulting conformations in gas-phase and in presence of water. These data would enable the evaluation of previous hypotheses of why enzymatic systems perturb ring geometries from the low-energy equatorial chair (4C1) conformation.
